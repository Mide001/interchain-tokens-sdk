# Contributing to Interchain Tokens SDK

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this SDK as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- We use TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint and Prettier are configured - run `npm run lint` to check your code
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and modular

## Commit Messages

Format your commit messages according to:

- feat: (new feature)
- fix: (bug fix)
- docs: (documentation changes)
- style: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc)
- refactor: (refactoring code)
- test: (adding tests, refactoring tests)
- chore: (updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc)

## Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Update tests when modifying existing functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR

## Documentation

- Update README.md with details of changes to the interface
- Update API documentation if endpoints or responses change
- Add examples for new features

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the package.json version if applicable
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of the maintainers
